% OVERVIEW %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  Describe the activity that would result if the proposal were funded and state
% the objectives and methods to be employed.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explosion of (genomics) data, drowning on data.
    \item Artifacts are common and cause data to be filtered out.
    \item Uncorrected errors in genomic datasets lead to bad alignments, etc.
    \item "This project will develop new computational methods to" solve those
        challenges.
    \item And teach computational skills to researchers and students.
\end{itemize}
% Intro paragraph
% Hook: alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics and
%	keystone in many areas such as comparative and functional genomic studies.
\blue{ Sequence alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics and a cornerstone
step in comparative and functional genomic studies.
% What is known: current knowledge in the field.
% Important topic, many computational tools exist with a variety of different approaches.
Due to its relevance, extensive investments have been made into developing the variety
of multiple sequence aligners that exist today.
% More info? Maybe something about it being an ad hoc problem
%
% Gap in knowledge
Despite these efforts, alignments produced by current computational tools
are suboptimal and often modified by hand before publication \parencite{hand_curation_morrison_2009}
or manually verified before accepted into benchmark databases, thus introducing an
irreproducible step.
% Critical need
Consequently, there is an urgent need for improving sequence accuracy and automatizing
all steps of the alignment pipeline.
}

% Second paragraph
% long-term goal
\blue{Therefore I propose to develop a novel approach that will generate more accurate multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs) improving downstream analyses including phylogenetic inference, detection
of selection and co-evolution, and identification of disease associated mutations.
% Proposal objectives
This will be done by developing a machine learning model that bridges the gap between the
output of state-of-the-art aligners and the improved results of manual curation by experienced
biologists and bioinformaticians.
% Rationale
Thus, utilizing robust and well-known machine learning models to simulate by-hand enhancements
is expected to produce high quality results,
% Pay-off
consequently allowing a time-saving and reproducible MSA pipeline.

% activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially
% transformative concepts.
\textbf{Intellectual Merit:}\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item COATi, "MSA that uses advance models to capture the biological and
        technical processes that shape genomic data."
    \item "Cutting edge models of protein-coding evolution".
    \item Handle heterogeneous datasets with "high and low quality data".
    \item User friendly and open-source.
    \item "Improve the analysis of genomic sequences, etc."
\end{itemize}

% Broader Impacts %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  Describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and
% contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
\textbf{Broader Impacts:}\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Software developed will be valuable in "numerous projects in comparative
        and functional genomics".
    \item This will have a positive impact in many fields.
    \item Ability to use larger datasets without discarding such amount of
        information and "reducing artifacts".
    \item Teach Carpentry workshops for "instructors at regional, tribal, and
        community colleges."
\end{itemize}
